A comprehensive database for hospital management was created and designed using SQL Server. The database includes the following tables:

Patients: Stores patient data such as name, gender, date of birth, medical record, and address.
Doctors: Stores doctor data including name, specialty, contact number, and email.
Appointments: Manages patient appointments with doctors, including date, time, and appointment status.
Billing: Manages invoices with details such as amount, date, and payment status.
The tables were linked using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. Initial data entries were added using SQL commands to perform various queries, including:

Calculating the total number of patients.
Displaying patients with a medical record.
Showing scheduled appointments.
Listing appointments for each doctor.
Displaying unpaid invoices.
Calculating the total billing amount for each patient.
Displaying patients associated with each doctor.
Generating a billing report for October.
